Description:
Customer churn prediction aims to identify customers likely to leave (churn) a service or subscription. 
By analyzing customer behavior, businesses can proactively retain at-risk users. In this project, 
we use a logistic regression model to predict churn from customer data using scikit-learn.

ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
Predicts churn (Yes/No) using behavioral and contract features

Preprocesses both categorical and numerical data

Evaluates performance with classification metrics and confusion matrix
